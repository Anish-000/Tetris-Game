# 🎮 Tetris Game in C++ (No Engine)


A simple and fully functional **Tetris game** built entirely in **C++**, without using any external game engines or graphics libraries. This console-based project is a tribute to the classic game, created with pure logic, manual rendering, and real-time input handling.


## 🚀 Project Highlights


- Core Tetris mechanics (tetromino generation, movement, rotation, line clearing)
- Console-based interface using standard C++ and system calls
- Minimal dependencies – runs directly in Windows terminal
- Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly code structure
